# Hi, I'm Kalyan 👋  

🚀 Java Backend Engineer | Full-Stack Experience (React) | Spring Boot | AWS | Microservices  
🎓 Master’s in Computer Science  
📍 Montgomery, AL | Open to Backend & Full-Stack Opportunities  

I’m a backend-focused full-stack software engineer with 3+ years of experience building scalable, production-ready applications using **Java, Spring Boot, React, and SQL/NoSQL databases**.  
I specialize in designing clean APIs, optimizing system performance, securing enterprise applications, and delivering reliable end-to-end solutions.

I enjoy working on real-world engineering problems involving **system design, performance tuning, cloud deployment, and automation** — not just demos or toy projects.
